The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid. Turbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5 deg from the incoming light direction.[1] source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity",EnvThes:10351,"http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/NCIM/C0311420, https://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/vocab/?tema=606"

EnvThes:20694,trees,,"A tree is a perennial woody plant. It is most often defined as a woody plant that has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground on a single main stem or trunk with clear apical dominance. A minimum height specification at maturity is cited by some authors, varying from 3 m to 6 m; some authors set a minimum of 10 cm trunk diameter (30 cm girth). Woody plants that do not meet these definitions by having multiple stems and/or small size are called shrubs. Compared with most other plants, trees are long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old and growing to up to 115 m (379 ft) high. Trees are an important component of the natural landscape because of their prevention of erosion and the provision of a weather-sheltered ecosystem in and under their foliage. They also play an important role in producing oxygen and reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as well as moderating ground temperatures. They are also elements in landscaping and agriculture, both for their aesthetic appeal and their orchard crops. Wood from trees is a building material, as well as a primary energy source in many developing countries.

"Invasive species', or invasive exotics, is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native habitats, with several definitions. The first definition, the most used, applies to non-indigenous species, or 'non-native', plants or animals that adversely affect the habitats and bioregions they invade economically, environmentally, and/or ecologically. They disrupt by dominating a region, wilderness areas, particular habitats, and/or wildland-urban interface land from loss of natural controls. This includes non-native labeled as exotic pest plants and invasive exotics, in restoration parlance, growing in native plant communities. It has been used in this sense by government organizations as well as conservation groups such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the California Native Plant Society. The European Union defines 'Invasive Alien Species' as those that are, firstly, outside their natural distribution area, and secondly, threaten biological diversity. It is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for noxious weeds. The kudzu vine (Pueraria lobata), Andean Pampas grass (Cortaderia jubata), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) are examples. The second definition includes the first, but broadens the boundaries to include indigenous or native species, with the non-native ones, that disrupt by a dominant colonization of a particular habitat or wildlands area from loss of natural controls . Deer are an example, considered to be overpopulating their native zones and adjacent suburban gardens, by some in the Northeastern and Pacific Coast regions of the United States. The third definition identifies invasive species as a widespread nonindigenous species. This one can be too broad, as not every nonindigenous or 'introduced' species has an adverse effect on a nonindigenous environment. A nonadverse example is the common goldfish, though common outside its native range globally, it is rarely in harmful densities to a native habitat. Because of the variability of its definition, and because definitions are often from a socio-economic perspective, the phrase invasive species is often criticized as an imprecise term for the scientific field of ecology. This article concerns the first two definitions; for the third, see Introduced species",invasive species,,"En invaderende art (eller en invasiv art) er en plante- eller dyreart som er innført i et område, hvor den kan fortrenge eller konkurrere med andre arter og på den måten forrykke den økologiske balansen mellom artene på stedet.

Dla Polski przykładami tego typu ptaków są: sowa śnieżna (Nyctea scandiaca) syberyjski podgatunek orzechówki (Nucifraga caryocatactes macrorhynos) krzyżodzioby: krzyżodziób świerkowy (L. curvirostra) krzyżodziób sosnowy (L. pytyopsittacus) krzyżodziób modrzewiowy (L. leucoptera) Niektóre gatunki wykazują jedynie pewien stopień tego typu inwazyjności manifestujący się fluktuacjami ilości wędrujących osobników, trasy przelotu i zasięgu. Z reguły są to gatunki odżywiające się mało zróżnicowanym pokarmem roślinnym. W przypadku nieurodzaju na danym terenie żerowania (zwykle zimowisku) większa niż zazwyczaj liczba osobników podejmuje dalszą wędrówkę w poszukiwaniu nowych żerowisk. Taką zwiększoną ilość osobników na trasie wędrówki określa się nalotem inwazyjnym. Przykładami tego typu gatunków inwazyjnych są dla Polski takie ptaki jak: czyż zwyczajny (Carduelis spinus) czeczotka zwyczajna (Carduelis flammea) dzięcioł duży (Dendrocopos major) jemiołuszka (Bombycilla garrulus) sójka zwyczajna (Garrulus glandarius) , ""Als Biologische Invasion (umgangssprachlich Einschleppung) bezeichnet man die Einwanderung einer Art in ein Gebiet, in dem sie nicht heimisch ist, und ihre Ausbreitung in diesem Gebiet.

L'artificialisation d'un milieu est facteur d'invasivité d'espèces qui ne le seraient pas ailleurs. , ""Als Neobiota bezeichnet man Arten und untergeordnete Taxa, die durch menschliche Einflussnahme Einzug in ein Gebiet erhielten, in dem sie nicht einheimisch sind. Als Unterbegriff für eingeschleppte Pflanzen ist Neophyten (Sing. Neophyt) gebräuchlich, analog dazu existiert für Tiere der Begriff Neozoen (Sing. Neozoon). Ein verschleppter Pilz ist ein Neomycet. Diese vier Begriffe sind vor allem im deutschsprachigen Raum gebräuchlich, im Englischen werden vorwiegend Begriffe wie invasive species (invasive Art) oder alien species ohne Unterscheidung zwischen Pflanzen, Tieren und Pilzen verwendet. Das zugehörige Teilgebiet der Biologie ist die Invasionsbiologie. Den Vorgang der Einschleppung, Etablierung und Ausbreitung im neuen Gebiet bezeichnet man als biologische Invasion. Zu den wichtigsten Transportmitteln für Neobiota gehört z. B. der weltweite Güterverkehr, der die unbeabsichtigte Verschleppung von Neobiota ermöglicht. Neobiota zeichnen sich meist durch typische Eigenschaften wie Anpassungsfähigkeit, hohe Fortpflanzungsrate und oft auch eine Assoziation mit Menschen aus. Diese Eigenschaften bestimmen im Zusammenspiel mit der Anfälligkeit des neuen Gebietes für biologische Invasoren und der Anzahl verschleppter Individuen (engl. propagule pressure) die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit, mit der sich nach einem Ausbreitungsereignis eine stabile Population etabliert. Während zahlreiche Neobiota keine merklichen negativen Auswirkungen verursachen, geht von einigen etablierten Neobiota ein stark negativer Einfluss auf die Biodiversität ihres neuen Lebensraumes aus. Oft verändert sich die Zusammensetzung der Biozönose beträchtlich, zum Beispiel durch Prädation oder als Folge von Konkurrenzdruck. Ebenso können Neobiota wirtschaftlichen Schaden anrichten, zum Beispiel als Forst- und Landwirtschaftsschädlinge. Gleichzeitig treten sie als Vektoren von Pathogenen in Erscheinung, welche teilweise auch Nutzpflanzen, Nutztiere und den Menschen befallen können. , ""En invasiv art är en art som introducerats till områden utanför sitt ursprungliga utbredningsområde, som sprider sig av egen kraft, som skadar ekosystemet som de introducerats till, har negativa effekter på jordbruk och dylikt, åstadkommer ekonomisk skada, eller påverkar hälsan negativt hos djur och människor. , ""Las especies invasoras son animales, plantas u otros organismos transportados e introducidos por el ser humano en lugares fuera de su área de distribución natural y que han conseguido establecerse y dispersarse en la nueva región, donde resultan dañinos. Que una especie invasora resulta dañina, significa que produce cambios importantes en la composición, la estructura o los procesos de los ecosistemas naturales o seminaturales, poniendo en peligro la diversidad biológica nativa (en diversidad de especies, diversidad dentro de las poblaciones o diversidad de ecosistemas). Debido a sus impactos en los ecosistemas donde han sido introducidas tales especies son consideradas ingenieros de ecosistemas. Los seres humanos han causado cambios sin precedentes en los ecosistemas de todo el planeta y han redistribuido las especies vegetales y animales de forma voluntaria o accidental. Como consecuencia de estos cambios ciertas especies tienen un comportamiento invasivo en las localidades de introducción, siendo más susceptibles los hábitats alterados o degradados. Estas invasiones llevan asociadas varios problemas. A nivel ecológico destaca la pérdida de diversidad autóctona y la degradación de los hábitats invadidos. Económicamente son importantes los efectos directos sobre las actividades agropecuarias y la salud pública. Una vez detectada la invasión, su control y erradicación son costosos y no siempre posibles.

ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve).
